<ul>
<li>You know what they say, a stranger is just a friend that you haven’t got time for</li>
<li>I have three sons.  I’m thrice a dad. You could say I’ve been thriced.  If you have four kids I guess you’ve been forced</li>
<li>I was asked to review a zoo website, but got stuck clicking on the lynx</li>
<li>I just spent ages trying to get today's shopping in the fridge. Strangely when I slid a dozen eggs in the last space at the bottom, the lowest shelf disappeared with a ping and there was lots more space at the top. Now I know what our smart fridge instructions meant by “Tetris mode”</li>
<li>Just got myself a big new set of wheels.  I have a feeling it’s going to really boost my sex appeal.  It’s a 2016 double decker bus.  Now I can look good on two totally different levels!</li>
<li>I’m developing a bold new tv sitcom about a sub-species of whale, learning to control an aircraft by remote control. Initially I’ll be starting by writing a pilot pilot pilot.</li>
<li>All my life I’ve been searching for tranquility. All sorted now. I’ve starting shooting myself with tranquilliser darts.</li>
<li>So the other day I was examining my testicles for any abnormalities, and the taxi driver said “mate, can you not do that please” and who even invited you to this panel discussion on the future of transport?</li>
<li>Working in the garden can be tricky. A hanging basket of herbs just fell and smashed on my head.  It was damn painful, but I laughed and laughed and laughed because of course tragedy plus thyme equals comedy.</li>
<li>I was wrestling with an internal dilemma and I tried to explain it like this: “I can’t decide - there are too many decisions in life, I get stuck. I think I want one thing and then I want another thing, but my mind just keeps flip flopping back and forth.  If only I could just settle on one particular option …”.  And the response I got was “Okay, but there are other people in line behind you who know what coffee they want, so maybe you could move aside?”</li>
<li>I was at the hardware store the other week, trying to find a wooden frame, some glass etc., and a sales assistant came up and asked if he could help me.  I said "nah mate, I'm just window shopping"</li>
</ul>
