Postgig: I have now done the Camden Eye! paid a forfeit! And fuck that was harder than the graduation show last Sunday, but I am still alive!

Forfeit was for mentioning masturbation, and the penalty was having to riff on why Boris Johnson is the best standup for 30 secs

I did know there would be forfeits before hand, but I had assumed my set was so esoteric that I would be unlikely to grab one.  But actually it was a great experience - I mean I totally failed to get any laughs out of Boris Johnson, but it was more stage time!

I also screwed up my set order, and got the most laughs from thanking the audience for laughing at the wrong point.
