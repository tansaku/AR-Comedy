So first run out of the Augmented Reality comedian with me wearing one of these https://moverio.epson.com/ devices so that I can see my set list floating in space in front of me while still being able to see the audience.

I was inspired by Markus attaching a small level to the microphone stand on which to place his set list at the Backyard comedy club before Xmas - and I thought what would an extrovert geek do that was similar? ðŸ™‚

I also took my tripod and recorded myself and all the acts.  Here's mine https://youtu.be/lhwjvnGNjbA - lots of work needed on my new material, or then again, maybe it's just one has to do 100 open mic nights to get access to rooms with larger comedy audiences before you can discover what's funny ...

I have now at least closed an evening (in Hampstead) and opened one (this one) so I'm getting the full range of experiences!

From Jollies at the George I seemed to get more laughs from my ad libbing and 50% of the non-comedian audience (1 of 2) complemented me on my imagery and stream of consciousness â€¦

Maybe I should be doing performance poetry instead â€¦ ðŸ¤”

Either way the met line got stuck on the way back and I was knackered after that late Monday night. 

A theme is starting to emerge regarding open mic nights:

1. the audience is 90% other comedians, 8% die hard comedy fans and 2% Tourette's sufferers
2. booking is mainly email/fb messenger and you can connect with the other comics on instagram
3. it is difficult to know how to judge the reactions to material given the majority of the audience are comedy nerds worrying about their upcoming set ...
