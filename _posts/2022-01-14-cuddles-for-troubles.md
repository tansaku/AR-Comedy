Cuddles for Troubles

Still felt a bit apprehensive during the day. Not as bad as Wednesday in the office. Running through the whole set in my lunch break helped

I think it was easier before `x`mas where my first two gigs were last minute drop out replacements.

This seems like the nicest location so far. Mainly a bringer audience but with 14 comics on the bill that manages to fill this small room.

As with all gigs I got there super early, so I had a good long time chilling my heels. Had a taco bar snack to keep me going. Feels like I’m starting to encounter more and more experienced comics. Couple of guys in the room at the beginning were talking about their Edinburgh shows.

I feel a bit calmer having got here, seen the room, double checked they aren’t too vicious with the 5min cut off.

I’ve stopped writing things on my hand although of course i have the AR and backup.

I was on 12th of 14 comics - long night

Post gig I listened back. It was okay. Didn’t get the laughs on the Boris jokes. I guess I had been hoping to improve on wednesday. The message from the MC in the AR headset got a laugh. Need to do the full analysis.

My friend was saying I was too fast and he preferred my previous material, and stupid vegan kfc burger on way home stuck in my throat.

But really positive support from another act called Jaz, who said stick to your guns and do 100 gigs. His first 30 played to silence apparently!
