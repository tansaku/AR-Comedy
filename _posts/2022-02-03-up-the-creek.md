Well not so nervous today, directing the day at work. Pretty tired. Maybe that helps. Slight frisson of excitement getting the DLR to the place. 

Routine of practicing walking over the river helps me feel it’s all under control. Practice each night helps too.  

This is just another gig. There are two more next week. Independently of how this one goes feels like I might want to develop something new for next week? Just thinking i want a largely new set for when i get back to rising stars Monday after next

Maybe old Norse ideas, and …? I guess experimenting with pattern of misdirection wasabi and wordplay palate cleansers …

Of course if i get blacked out I’ll try the same again next week, on Monday at least …

So the first 5 acts all made the five, but now they’ve changed who’s holding the cards, and the next two were cut off quite brutally

Horned off at two minutes.  Frustrating as I thought I got a lot of laughs.  It’s all got a bit rowdy in the second half

Got some really good audience interaction. Not going to bother coming here again. Lot of time and hassle for only two minutes …

Lovely big comedy audience though …  I wonder, are the pure comedian open mic audiences leading me in the wrong direction … I’d love to regularly play to a room with that many people (it was like a 100) - I guess I’m too early and if I hadn’t missed my stop on the train I’d have been in the Easter first half. Oh well, back to my regular gigs - MC made snide remark about my AR glasses - maybe I need to ditch those too …

I had also considered adjusting my set order to put what I thought was a stronger joke in the first two minutes (because of the blackout rule) but I kept the order the same … I think I’ll keep sticking to my guns …  all grist for the experience mill …

Thanks, really appreciate the support.  There was a mix of levels last night.  One other person was on their 4th gig - went first in the night, did fine - full 5 mins; but the MC made a real effort to get the audience riled up as the night went on; switching the blackout card holders etc.  I'm told these events are luck of the draw about when you're on and who's holding the cards.  There were comics last night who'd done 50+ and also multi-year folks who had some great sets.  My scatter gun approach to booking gigs meant I hadn't realised this was black out when I booked it.

I'm busted up inside, but it's great practise in dieing.  I've done 11 gigs before this and every time got a fair modicum of laughs (one comic told me he did his first 30 to silence).  If last night was not a blackout I'd have got to the end of my set, and got a few more laughs, but last night was not an open mic, it was a club.  I'll take the frustration and anger and direct that into developing new material and hitting more open mics.  I might try again at "up the creek" once I've done 50 and have front loaded the first two minutes of my set with jokes that really drunken "we enjoy stamping on ants" people will get a kick out of.

I've not had any substantive feedback from any MCs so far.  it's ranged from nothing, to "well done", to last night's snide "he forgot to write any jokes in his memory glasses" that prompted me to walk out the club.  I feel like the recordings are the best feedback ...

Anyway, almost 11am - gonna try to follow Sarah Millican's rule ...
