Monkey Business

So I wasn't so anxious as work in preparation for this gig, at least compared to last weeks office day gig at Not Another Comedy Night. I think partly because of being quite tired from early start and office yoga. I wonder if I'm getting used to the pre-gig jitters? I can definitely still feel something. I have some foreboding about what kind of gig it will be since I think I encouraged a lot of my co-graduates from the Amused Mooses comedy course to book the same gig.  However when I got there the pub the gig is in looks pretty well to do.  

And this time I’m eating in advance to try and avoid the indigestion I had from last Friday.

It feels different today ad this will be the first gig since graduation that I do with AMers. For many (all?) of them this is their first gig since graduation, while this is my 7th … 

I went through my whole set under my breath walking over bridges across the Thames at lunchtime and on the train on the way to the gig, and I'm excited about a few new things to try out.

Kings of looking forward to getting it done as it’s been a long day, and Friday Saturday Sunday without gigs just working on the routine feels like something to look forward to. Got the podcast on Sunday as well.  

Part of me feels like I’ve kind of trapped myself in a comedy train and I can’t get off :-) I’m anxious to do my 100, but will that really make any difference?

Post gig I feel a bit deflated.  I got some laughs as did all my fellow AMers, but one Irish guy really took the roof off, showing us all how it's done.  My Super-Ego character didn't really get anything like that response causing me to want to create a completely new set for next time around.
