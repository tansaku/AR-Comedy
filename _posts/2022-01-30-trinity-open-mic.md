Trinity Open Mic

Well, just did 15mins at a mixed music, poetry open mic.  Got a few laughs but difficult to get anything flowing over the top of people chatting with their friends.  Maybe I should have shushed them, but it was what they’d been doing with the other acts (music, poetry) and I kept on thinking if I can be funny enough they’ll focus on me …

Useful stage time I guess, but I’ll probably stick to actual comedy nights going forward …
