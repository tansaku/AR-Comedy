Not Another Comedy Night

Felt somewhat anxious in advance. This was the first time I did a gig after a full day in the office, and in front of one of my coworkers.

The gig was starting a little later than I’m used to (8pm) and I had a starter and salad in the pub, which seemed to work out okay. Got approval for my 5min 10sec set from the organiser which helped in the run up.

The AR headset worked through the whole gig for the first time, and I didn’t end up using my comedy cheap and cheerful version built out of a bicycle rear view mirror.

Another comic said this lovely thing to me:
“You have a sick stage presence man, people have no idea what you’re going to say next”

Another comic said I had a back to the future doc brown vibe - but younger. Phew!
