Lollipops

So the day felt a bit calmer - feeling good off back of cuddles for troubles.

Did lunch rehearsal, but can feel tension energy once I hit 4:30 …

Now on train home. Several of the first half acts didn’t stick around for the second half and we lost a couple audience members so the room was a bit light. At the end my bringer was keen to split, and I had no input from anyone. The MC complimented one other comedian on one of his jokes. I thanked the MC and organiser for giving me time, but they seemed preoccupied with clearing up. 

I offered video to the MC and followed him on Instagram to have a way to pass on the videos, for which he said thanks; but it was a little bit crushing to have no one say anything positive (or even negative) about my act.

Watching my set back I feel like I got some good laughs in the first half, but not so much in the second.  Problem with this set is that my center piece lines get silence; and then I get something off the back of that …

I’d prefer to be working with a set with some more bankable lines.  The spliff one works, the scientist part one worked well tonight … maybe it’s all just working on better delivery …

And none of the comics stayed around to chat … I guess it was Monday and the energy at the end was low …..

To be honest I would rather do jollies at the george again than this even though it's closer

But I learned some things. Boris Johnson jokes can get groans … too hacky maybe? So maybe I drop the topical bits from the  kitchen stuff.  And I think "Freud’s 1899 analysis of jokes" is better phrasing than "Freud’s analysis of jokes in 1899"
